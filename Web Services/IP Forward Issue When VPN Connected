Network Setup:

10.0.0.1 Router: to internet
10.0.0.70 Server: Ubuntu based server,default gateway is 10.0.0.1
10.0.0.51 PC

I created a PPTP connection(interface: ppp0) on Server to a machine on the internet, what I want to do is route all the traffic from certain IP address(10.0.0.51) through the PPTP connection and then to the internet. What I did are:

Set the gateway on PC(10.0.0.51) as 10.0.0.70
Enabled ipv4 forward on 10,0,0,70
Add the masquerade rule to iptable:
# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -s 10.0.0.51 -j MASQUERADE
After that, it seems none of the traffic from 10.0.0.51 be redirected to ppp0, instead these traffic are still going through 10.0.0.1 directly.

Any thoughts on it?

Assuming that the internal interface on Ubuntu gateway is eth0.

Add more 2 below rules:

# iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o ppp0 -s 10.0.0.51 -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A FORWARD -i ppp0 -o eth0 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
and make sure that you removed the old gateway on the client:

# route del default gw 10.0.0.1 dev <ethx>




You can automate the restore process at reboot by installing an additional package for iptables 
which takes over the loading of the saved rules. To this with the following command.

# sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent

After the installation the initial setup will ask to save the current rules for IPv4 and IPv6, 
just select Yes and press enter for both.

If you make further changes to your iptables rules, 
remember to save them again using the same command as above. 
The iptables-persistent looks for the files rules.v4 and rules.v6 under /etc/iptables.

These are just a few simple commands you can use with iptables, 
which is capable of much more. Read on to check on some of the other options available for more advanced control over iptable rules.
