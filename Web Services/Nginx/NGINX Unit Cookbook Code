The first step for using NGINX Unit is installing it.

> Red Hat-Based Systems (.rpm)
Problem :
    You need to install NGINX Unit on Red Hat, CentOS, or Amazon Linux.
Solution :
    Create a file named "/etc/yum.repo.d/unit.repo" that contains the following contents :
    ************
    [unit]
    name=unit repo
    baseurl=https://packages.nginx.org/unit/<OS>/$releasever/$basearch/
    gpgcheck=0
    enabled=1
    ************
    Alter the file, replacing <OS> with rhel, centos, amzn, or amzn2, depending on your distribution.
    
    install the Unit base package :
    # yum install unit
